Introduction to Git and GitHub
1. What is Git?

Version Control System: Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work.
History of Git: Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for developing the Linux kernel, Git has since become the most widely used version control system in the world.
2. Key Concepts of Git:

Repository (Repo): A repository is a directory that stores all the files and their revision history. Think of it as a project folder that contains all your code and its history.
Commit: A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit contains a message that describes the changes made.
Branch: A branch is a separate line of development. You can create a new branch to work on a feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.
Merge: Merging combines changes from one branch into another, usually integrating new features or fixes into the main branch.
3. What is GitHub?

Cloud-Based Platform: GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a web interface for managing Git repositories and offers features like issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.
Collaboration: GitHub is widely used for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, review each other's code, and manage project tasks.
Community and Open Source: GitHub is home to millions of open-source projects. It's a great place to contribute to existing projects and showcase your work to the developer community.
4. Why Use Git and GitHub?

Collaboration: Git and GitHub make it easy to collaborate with others on coding projects, regardless of where you are in the world.
Backup: Your code is safely stored in the cloud, and you can always roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.
Project Management: GitHub provides tools for managing your project's progress, tracking issues, and discussing ideas with your team.
5. Getting Started:

Setting Up Git: Install Git on your computer and configure your username and email.
Creating a Repository: Learn how to create a new Git repository, add files, and make your first commit.
Pushing to GitHub: Understand how to connect your local repository to GitHub and push your changes online.
Basic Commands:
git init - Initialize a new Git repository.
git add - Stage changes for the next commit.
git commit - Save your changes to the repository.
git push - Upload your changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
git pull - Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
6. Hands-On Exercise:

Create a GitHub account.
Set up a local Git repository.
Make some commits.
Push your changes to GitHub.
Open a pull request and merge it.
